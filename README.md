Work done on my free time from How to Design Programs inspired by reading about Paul Graham and Peter Seibel

A lot of inspiration for pursuing a B.S in Computer Science came from learning about the Lisp family of programming languages I felt it was important the keep it here.

(Note ^ Clean up files from testing and add readable comments I can't even read some of these)
